# C Playground - `loadavg`

Get the CPU load and print it color coded to specific thresholds.

This program is part of my personal desktop environment setup which uses either
of [polybar][polybar] or [waybar][waybar] depending on the window manager. It
thus contains the color codes for the appropriate bar tools.

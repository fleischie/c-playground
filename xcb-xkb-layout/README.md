# C Playground - `xcb-xkb-layout`

Print the currently used keyboard layout using the `xcb` library and it's `xkb`
extensions.

This program was originally intended to be part of my personal
[polybar][polybar] config, but a) polybar already provides this module and b) I
wanted ISO 639 codes and could only achieve this via Xlib's keyboard extension.

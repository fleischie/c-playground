# C Playground - `x11-xkb-layout`

Print the currently used keyboard layout using the `X11`/`Xlib` library and
it's `xkb` extensions.

This program is fairly similar to [xcb-xkb-layout](../xcb-xkb-layout/) but uses
the `Xlib` library instead of `xcb`. The `X11` version was actually the second
implementation of this layout just to see, which of the two would be easier to
program and to understand.
